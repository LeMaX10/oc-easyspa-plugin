# About

Adds Single Page Application like features to the OctoberCMS frontend using the OctoberCMS AJAX framework. More specifically, it enables (through the adding of a component to your layout) loading and updating page content through AJAX.

# Current Support

Only loading new pages (Static Pages or CMS Pages, any URL that is controlled by the CMS) is currently supported. Components on dynamically loaded pages will work, however assets (stylesheets and scripts) will not be added or removed as required
